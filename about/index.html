        Hello! I'm an undergrad at U.C. Berkeley studying Electrical Engineering and Computer Science. I am a UGSI (also known as a TA) for <a href="https://www.cs61a.org">CS 61A</a> and a project manager working on software for <a href="https://pioneers.berkeley.edu">Pioneers in Engineering</a>. Some of my CS interests include computer architecture, optimization, and artificial intelligence. This is what I look like:
