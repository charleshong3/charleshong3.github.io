        Hi! I'm a student at U.C. Berkeley studying Electrical Engineering and Computer Science. 
    </p>
    <p>
        This past summer, I worked as an Computer Architecture Architecture Intern in <a href="https://www.nvidia.com/object/tegra.html">Nvidia</a>'s Tegra SoC group. 
        I'm currently a UGSI (also known as a TA) for <a href="https://inst.eecs.berkeley.edu//~eecs151/fa20/">EECS 151</a>, 
        having TAed for <a href="https://www.cs61a.org">CS 61A</a> and <a href="https://www.cs61c.org">CS 61C</a> in the past. 
        I'm also heavily involved in a STEM outreach club called <a href="https://pioneers.berkeley.edu">Pioneers in Engineering</a> (check out our <a href="https://www.github.com/pioneers">Github</a>!). 
    </p>

        My CS interests lie at the intersection of hardware and software, especially in computer architecture and broadly in computer engineering. 
        This is what I look like:

        Here's what my dog Toby looks like:
