    <p>
        Hello! I'm an undergrad at U.C. Berkeley studying Electrical Engineering and Computer Science. 
        This past summer, I worked as an Architecture Intern in <a href="https://www.nvidia.com/object/tegra.html">Nvidia</a>'s Tegra SoC group. 
        I am a UGSI (also known as a TA) for <a href="https://www.cs61c.org">CS 61C</a>, having TAed for <a href="https://www.cs61a.org">CS 61A</a> in the past, 
        and the Director of Software Engineering at <a href="https://pioneers.berkeley.edu">Pioneers in Engineering</a> (check out our <a href="https://www.github.com/pioneers">Github</a>!). 
        My CS interests lie at the intersection of hardware and software, mainly in computer architecture and broadly in computer engineering. 
        This is what I look like:
